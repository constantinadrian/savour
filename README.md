        - Palette:

            ![Palette Colors](static/readme/palette_coolors.png) 

    -  ##### Typography

        - For this project I choose three types of Google Fonts: 'Crete Round', 'Lato' and 'Mr Dafoe'.

          For the consistency:

            - 'Mr Dafoe' fonts were used for the welcome text on landing page when user enters the site

            - 'Crete Round' fonts were used for the recipes and products title

            - 'Lato' fonts were used for the section titles and all other paragraphs within the page.

    -  ##### Imagery

        - Because imagery is important I have carefully chosen the background hero image on landing page, as well as all others banners within the site that will reflect the site and each page purpose.

- ### Deployment

  - #### Inception project 

    1. This project was created from the Code Institute project template from [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) on Github by clicking on "Use this template"

        ![](static/readme/code-institute-project-template.png)

    2. Once the project was created I rename it from the settings 

        ![](static/readme/rename-project-from-settings.png)

    3. When the repository was finally completed I open the project with [Gitpod](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en) in Chrome browser

    4. In order to push this project from Gitpod on Github a set of commands were used:

        ```
        - git status  - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files 

        - git add .  - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it 

        - git commit -m "message for commit"  - Commits all the changes

        - git push  - Pushes all committed versions to Github
        ```

  - #### Heroku

    - The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

        1. Create ```requirements.txt``` file that contains a list of our Python dependencies by typing in the terminal 
        
            ```
            pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
            ```

        2. Create ```Procfile``` file that tells Heroku how to run our project by typing in the terminal

            ```
            echo web: python run.py > Procfile
            ```

        3. Push the ```requirements.txt``` and ```Procfile``` file to github with the following commands

            ```
            git add -A

            git commit -m

            git push
            ```

        4. In order to deploy to Heroku you need an [account](https://signup.heroku.com/login?redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fid.heroku.com%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fclient_id%3Dd2ef2b24-e72c-4adf-8506-28db2218547d%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Dglobal%252Cplatform%26state%3DSFMyNTY.g2gDbQAAADFodHRwczovL2Rhc2hib2FyZC5oZXJva3UuY29tL2F1dGgvaGVyb2t1L2NhbGxiYWNrbgYAnwF4L3kBYgABUYA.q2PQc0k53ICJ0LR6VFKbOkyuEqmEtG0iuVzTM38UNAI)

        5. Now you can create an new app from the dashboard ````New``` Menu

        ![](static/readme/heroku-app.jpg)

        6. Now you need to set up a name and select a region closest to you

            NOTE: Remember the name has to be unique and generally use a dash and lowercase letters

        6. From the dashboard of your app click on the settings and go to Reveal Config variables

        ![](static/readme/heroku-settings.jpg)

        7. Set up the Config Vars 

            | Key             | Value                                                                                                       |
            | :---------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
            | IP              | 0.0.0.0                                                                                                     |
            | MONGO_DBNAME    | <your_database>                                                                                             |
            | MONGO_URI       | mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<your_cluster>.ol3x3.mongodb.net/<yourdatabase>?retryWrites=true&w=majority |
            | PORT            | 5000                                                                                                        |
            | SECRET_KEY      | <your_secret_key>                                                                                           |      

        8. Hide the Config Vars

        9. Now from the dashboard of your app click on the Deploy and from Deployment method select ```Github - Connect to Github```. Next on the search field type the name of the repository you want to deploy.
        
        ![](static/readme/heroku-deploy.jpg)

        10. Once it finds your repository click ```Connect``` 

        11. Next you can click ```Enable Automatic Deploys```

        ![](static/readme/heroku-enable-automatic-deploys.jpg)

        12. Now From Manual Deploy you can click ```Deploy Branch``` and once it's finish you can click ```View```

        ![](static/readme/heroku-deploy-branch-view.jpg) 

  - #### Local Clone

    ##### In oder to run this project locally you should have installed this 3 requirements on your machine plus an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/):

    1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE or your personal preference

    2. [Pyhton3](https://www.python.org/) - to run the application on your local machine

    3. [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for installation of tools needed in this project.

    Now you can create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) and follow the steps from [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). The MongoDB collection for this project can be found [here](static/savour_collections)
    
    Optional: you can install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

    ##### Steps to follow

    1. At the top of the repository click on Code and click on download zip and extracting the zip file to your chosen folder or keep the same name

        ![](static/readme/code-clone.jpg)

    Optional: if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) install on your machine you can type

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/constantinadrian/savour
    ```

    or to clone the repository into different name on the folder you can run 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/constantinadrian/savour folder_name
    ```

    more info about cloning with git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

    2. Create a virtual environment within the project directory to keep dependencies required by the project separate from other projects by creating an isolated Python virtual environment.

    ```
    py -3 -m venv venv
    ```

    3. Activate the environment

    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    NOTE: If you run on Linux/maxOS more info for step 2 and 3 [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/) 

    4. Install all dependencies from requirements.txt:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: For upgrade PIP type this command ```pip3 install --upgrade pip```

    5. Declare default environment variables in a file ```env.py``` 

    ```
    import os

    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_secret_key")
    os.environ.setdefault(
        "MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<your_cluster>.ol3x3.mongodb.net/<yourdatabase>?retryWrites=true&w=majority")   
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<yourdatabase>")
    ```
    6. Add ```env.py``` to your ```.gitignore``` file.

    7. To run the project run 
    ```
    flask run
    ```

    NOTE: to run the project with ```py app.py``` on the ```app.py``` file change the code from line 1068 to

    ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()
    ``` 

    8. Now you can visit the website at http://127.0.0.1:5000
