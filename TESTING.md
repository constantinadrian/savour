- ### Bugs and Fixes

    - After login users can access the profile of other users

        - To fix: I block access of each user viewing the other profile I added a check and if a user is not in session["user"] will be redirected to 403 Denied/Forbidden Page

        ```
        if username != session["user"]:
            return redirect(url_for('error', code=403))
        ``` 

    - If the user alters the recipe id when trying to view/edit/delete the recipe the app crashes with the following error

        ![](static/readme/bson-errors-InvalidId.jpg)

        - To fix: I added a function to check the ObjectId if is valid or not (See Credit Code)

    - If the admin decided to Delete a category the specific category was deleted automatic but was creating an issue if the category was having one or more recipes
    
        - To fix: a query was made on recipes collection to count how many recipes the specific category has. If the return was one or more we revoke the delete command and show a message to the admin. 

    - If the admin decided to edit a category already in use the category was updated but now we couldn't access the recipes from the old category on the Recipes drop-menu on the navbar

        - To fix: I update the old category with a different query using "find_one_and_update" and return the old document. After returning the old document made a second query and update the category on each recipe that was in the specific category

    - Required attribute not working on Safari (IOS) and when the user submitted an empty form on add recipe an error occurred

        ![](static/readme/attribute-error.png)

        - To fix: I added jquery validation on the client-side to stop the user from submitting an empty form and I added a check on the server-side to check if the user fills each field

    - jQuery validation error messages not working properly on fields created dynamically

        - This was happening because all the ingredients/steps fields created dynamically were having the same name attribute

        - To fix: I made each name unique by adding a number at the end of each name

    - On Safari (IOS) the collapse menu is not closing when click/touch outside the navbar

        - To fix: I added touch event "touchstart" and was working after that

    - When click on shop items and the modal displays the item card had a blue outline border on IOS devices only

        - To fix: add new rule on css "outline: 0 !important;"

    - Pagination for Search Page not displaying properly when accessing the second page 

        - To fix: change the form method from POST to GET and everything was working fine

    - On small screen size the width for display cards were not the same

        - To fix: added width of 100% on cards and change the width of card parent for different screen size
